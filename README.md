# Generated Books

On this page, you find multiple Jupyter Books which were generated by artificial intelligence (AI). At the moment, we differentiate two kinds of books you find here.

## Generated Books

These books were generated using AI from scratch:
* [Introduction to Python Basics](https://generated-books.github.io/python-basics/intro.html)

## Translated Books

These books were generated using AI by translating books in other places:
* [Notizbücher zur Bio-Bildanalyse (German)](https://generated-books.github.io/bio-bildanalyse-notebooks/intro.html)
